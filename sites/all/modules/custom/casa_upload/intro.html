<p>This 3-step tool makes it easy to contribute your photos and turn them into a collection of scientific observations.</p>

<p>In this first step, you can upload all your recent photos, which will be called <strong><em>pictures</em></strong>. You'll also be able to add information about the pictures after each is uploaded. These pictures will become part of a <strong><em>collection</em></strong>; you can add information about the collection later.</p>

<p>In the next step, you'll group your pictures into <strong><em>observations</em></strong>, because, for instance, you may have several photos of each species in each location.</p>

<p>The last step will allow you to add all sorts of information to the observations. You'll be able to add <strong><em>identifications</em></strong> - what species you think it is - and <strong><em>interactions</em></strong> between your observations and other species.</p>

<p>You can leave this Contribute process at any time, and your contributions will be saved. You can continue with this collection at any time by visiting <a href="my/contributions">My Contributions</a>.</p>
