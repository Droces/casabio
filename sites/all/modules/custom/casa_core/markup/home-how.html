    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Anyone can sign up</h3>
      <p>CasaBio is free to use for anyone; students, teachers, researchers,
        conservationists, any everyone else</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Contributors upload their photos</h3>
      <p>Photographs of plants and animals can be uploaded in bulk or
        individually.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Photos become observations</h3>
      <p>The photos of the same species are grouped together as observations.
        These are tagged with information such as date, location, etc.
        The observations can be identified as a particular species or taxon.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Anyone can browse the contributions</h3>
      <p>You don't need to have an account to browse the pictures, observations,
        identifications, species, and other types of information.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Observations are identified</h3>
      <p>Anyone in the community can vote to help identify observations, and
        tag the interaction between species in the photos.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Researchers and conservationists can browse in detail </h3>
      <p>Using powerful filters, questions like "Which species are found in
        this area?", or "Where has this species been sighted, and when?" can
        easily be answered, along with questions regarding habitats and species
        interactions.</p>

        <h3>Find observations of species</h3>
        <p>Anyone can contribute their photographs of plants and animals they've
          seen, which become observations with all sorts of useful information.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h3>Identifications, habitats, more...</h3>
        <p>Observations are identified as a particular species, genus, etc. by
          the community. Interactions between species, habitats or threats
          observed, and other information are also added.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>See it all on a map</h3>
        <p>Discover which taxa were seen where, when, and under which
          conditions. See where species co-exist, or even where they migrate.</p>
