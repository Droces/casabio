## About CasaBio

CasaBio is a platform for saving and managing scientific observations of organisms. It was developed for David Gywnne-Evans; aka. The Naked Botanist.

CasaBio is currently completely personally funded by David Gwynne-Evans. We're currently looking for financial supporters and donors.

CasaBio was developed by Dane Rossenrode, of [Touchdreams](http://touchdreams.co.za/). You can [contact him](http://touchdreams.co.za/contact_us) through the Touchdreams website.

CasaBio is powered by [Drupal](http://drupal.org/); possibly the world's most powerful and flexible content management system.


## Developer Documentation

For detailed information on the code that powers CasaBio, see the [Developer Documentation](http://casabio.org/api).


## REST API

CasaBio has a REST API that supports all standard CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on content. For example, it allows a client to view a list of observations, or create new identifications. See the [REST API Documentation](http://casabio.org/API-documentation), or contact the developers for more info.
